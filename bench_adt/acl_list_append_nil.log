ACL2 !>(defthm append-nil (equal (append x nil) x))    

ACL2 Warning [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM APPEND-NIL ...):  A newly proposed
:REWRITE rule generated from APPEND-NIL probably subsumes the previously
added :REWRITE rule APPEND-TO-NIL, in the sense that the new rule will
now probably be applied whenever the old rule would have been.


*1 (the initial Goal, a key checkpoint) is pushed for proof by induction.

Perhaps we can prove *1 by induction.  One induction scheme is suggested
by this conjecture.  

We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (APPEND X NIL). 
This suggestion was produced using the :induction rule BINARY-APPEND.
If we let (:P X) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use
is
(AND (IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP X)) (:P (CDR X)))
              (:P X))
     (IMPLIES (ENDP X) (:P X))).
This induction is justified by the same argument used to admit BINARY-APPEND.
When applied to the goal at hand the above induction scheme produces
two nontautological subgoals.
Subgoal *1/2
Subgoal *1/2'
Subgoal *1/1
Subgoal *1/1'
Subgoal *1/1''
Subgoal *1/1'''

([ A key checkpoint while proving *1 (descended from Goal):

Subgoal *1/1''
(IMPLIES (NOT (CONSP X)) (NOT X))

A goal of NIL, Subgoal *1/1''', has been generated!  Obviously, the
proof attempt has failed.
